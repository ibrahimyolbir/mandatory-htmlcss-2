#### Instructions
In this lab, you will build a layout using HTML and CSS.

You have to use flexbox and media queries.

Create an HTML page and make a layout for a streaming service for movies. You have received a number of images for different films on the service. You can find the pictures in the folder resources included in the repository at

https://github.com/LinkNorth/HTMLCSS/tree/master/labs/lab2. You’re also allowed to use your own images.

The layout should be responsive and built according to the following requirements:

- Create a header with a title and three links. The headline should cover the entire width of the page.

- If the window width is less than 700px, the links should not be visible and the title text should be centered.

- The images should be displayed with img tags.

- All images should be displayed sequentially on several lines depending on the screen size.
- Each row should display as many images as it can.

- When there is no space for more pictures in a row, the remaining images will appear on a new row.

- The width of an image should not be less than 150 pixels. The images should have a margin of between 20 to 40 pixels to each other.

- The images should change their size so they always fill out a row regardless of how many images there are.

- All images in the same row should be equal in size.

- The layout must meet the requirements no matter how many images you choose to
display.

- The pictures below illustrate how the layout works in larger and smaller window sizes.
